;;; org-protocol-capture-html.el --- Capture HTML with org-protocol

;;; Commentary:

;; This package captures Web pages into Org-mode using Pandoc to
;; process HTML.  It can also use python-readability to get article
;; content.

;; These are the helper functions that run in Emacs.  To capture pages
;; into Emacs, you can use either a browser bookmarklet or the
;; org-protocol-capture-html.sh shell script.  See the README.org file
;; for instructions.

;;; Code:

This function is basically a copy of `org-protocol-do-capture', but
it passes the captured content (not the URL or title) through
Pandoc, converting HTML to Org-mode."

  ;; It would be nice to not basically duplicate
  ;; `org-protocol-do-capture', but passing the data back to that
  ;; function would require re-encoding the data into a URL string
  ;; with Emacs after Pandoc converts it.  Since we've already split
  ;; it up, we might as well go ahead and run the capture directly.
