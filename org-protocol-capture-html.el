;;; org-protocol-capture-html.el --- Capture HTML with org-protocol

;;; Commentary:

;; This package captures Web pages into Org-mode using Pandoc to
;; process HTML.  It can also use eww's eww-readable functionality to
;; get the main content of a page.

;; These are the helper functions that run in Emacs.  To capture pages
;; into Emacs, you can use either a browser bookmarklet or the
;; org-protocol-capture-html.sh shell script.  See the README.org file
;; for instructions.
